# Season
A season is composed of n weeks (10 was used, but can be changed). Season demand is generated by week and at the sku 
level. The simulated demand is configured to aim for -30/+15 percent of the total network space each week. An even portion of a DC's
storage space is allocated per sku. From there a random percent within the -30/+15 range is sampled. That percent difference
from the actual value becomes the sku forecast for the simulation. 

<i>sku forecast</i> = <i>sku actual</i> * (1 + <i>sampled %</i>)
## Improvements
* Material location variability (i.e. not every material at every dc)
* Variable percent changes for demand instead of flat -30/+15  
    * variability per item
    * variability at points in the season
* Smart orders when space is limited
  * currently if space is limited it will pull in full amounts of forecasted products
  * not adjusting the forecast value in-season here results in high fail rates because a few products are taking up most of the network space
  * this explains the high failures at the end of the seasons in the availability results
