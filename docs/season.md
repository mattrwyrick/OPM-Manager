# Season
A season is composed of n (10 was used, but can be changed) weeks. Season demand is generated by week and at the sku 
level. The simulated demand is configured to aim for -30/+15 percent network space availability. An even portion of a DC's
storage space is allocated per sku. From there a random percent within the range is sampled. The sku level demand for 
the simulation becomes the portion alloted times (1 + percent change).  

## Improvements
* Material location variability (i.e. not every material at every dc)
* Variable percent changes for demand instead of flat -30/+15  
    * variability per item
    * variability at points in the season
